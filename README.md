# Cat-and-Dog-Image-Classifier


## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying images as either cats or dogs. The classifier is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and trained on a diverse dataset of cat and dog images.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset, sub-divided into training, validation, and test sets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for the image classifier.
- `models/`: Saved model checkpoints.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Promit-Biswas/Cat-and-Dog-Image-Classifier.git
